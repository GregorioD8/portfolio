Yes, turning projects into dedicated pages and using a 3D card interface as a portal to those pages would create a highly immersive and professional experience, especially if it mimics the interaction style. Here's how we can implement this concept:

Proposed Workflow
3D Card as a Gateway:

Each project card leads to a dedicated page.
Clicking a card animates it and transitions the user to the project’s dedicated page.
Video as Modal:

On the project page, the video would open in a full-screen modal.
The modal overlays additional project details over the video for an interactive experience.
Project Pages:

Each project gets its own detailed page, including:
Video
Description
Technologies used
GitHub and live demo links
Additional media or interactive elements.
Steps to Implement
1. Update the 3D Cards to Navigate to Pages
Modify the Portfolio3D component to make the cards clickable and route users to individual project pages.

2. Create a Project Page Layout
Each project will have its own page with details and the modal video overlay.


3. Routing with React Router
Integrate React Router to handle navigation between the 3D Portfolio and the Project Pages.

4. CSS Enhancements

Final UX Flow
Landing Page:

A 3D portfolio grid with cards representing each project.
Clicking a card animates and navigates to the project page.
Project Page:

Features:
A modal for video playback.
Detailed project description, technologies, and CTAs for GitHub/Live Demo.
Responsive clean Aesthetic:

Minimalist design with full-screen modal videos.
Clean layout emphasizing interactivity and polish.
